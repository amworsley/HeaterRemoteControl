A basic set of python/shell scripts to control an Arduino controller heater.
The heater control is just an cheap RF remote control  power switch on my heater and
subject to Arduino control as describe in this really neat project

  o Requires debian python python-serial packages
  o Compiling ino file under command line possible using arduino-core and Arduino.mk

  o ino/ApplianceRemoteControlTemp/ApplianceRemoteControlTemp.ino - Arduino C/C++
source for Arduino controller that toggles remote control on/off depending on the
temperature it reads in on the Temperature sensor.

  Compiling Arduino firmware
You need to cd into the ino/ApplianceRemoteControlTemp directory and type make. This will generate
a files in the build-cli subdirectory (including a .cpp file) and a .hex file. make upload will
attempt to upload the firmware through the serial device defined in the makefile (/dev/ttyACM0 by defaault).
